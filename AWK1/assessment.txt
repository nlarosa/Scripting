1. 

	i)	First of all, this course should include more complicated examples during
		the lectures. I really enjoy the challenges of the homework, but I oftentimes
		find myself searching Google for help because I cannot find appropriate
		information in the lecture slides. 

	ii)	Secondly, I would like if the coding examples used during the lectures 
		were posted somewhere in the AFS folder. I know James included many of 
		them during his lectures, however, it would be great if these were more
		regularly posted. I oftentimes attempt to write down these commands but find
		myself cut off by a lecture transition.

2.	I think the book does a great job explaining utilities and providing
	listings of these utilities' options. However, I think that it would be great
	if the book provided more complicated examples. Although they do provide many
	examples, I have found that they neglect some of the more difficult elements
	of utilities, such as AWK and SED scripting.

3.	I do believe that the lecture slides are quite helpful for this
	course. Besides needing more complicated examples, I do think that they
	provide a great base (ie. basic command options) from which to begin using 
	many UNIX utilities and commands.

4. 	
	i) 	AWK scripting (separating by fields)

	ii) 	How to utilize VI to its full extent with regular expressions
		and other helpful commands.
